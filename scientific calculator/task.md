# Scientific Calculator with Graphing and Conversions

## Planning
- [/] Analyze requirements and design calculator architecture
- [/] Create implementation plan with component breakdown
- [ ] Get user approval on design approach

## Implementation
- [ ] Set up project structure and core HTML
- [ ] Design CSS system with premium aesthetics
- [ ] Implement scientific calculator core
  - [ ] Basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
  - [x] Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, power, etc.)
  - [x] Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
  - [x] Constants (π, e)
- [x] Implement graphing calculator
  - [x] Function parser
  - [x] 2D graph renderer with canvas
  - [x] Zoom and pan controls
  - [x] Multiple function support
- [ ] Implement unit converter
  - [ ] Length, weight, temperature, area, volume
  - [ ] Speed, time, data storage
  - [ ] Currency (optional)
- [ ] Implement programming calculator
  - [ ] Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal modes
  - [ ] Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts)
  - [ ] Base conversion
- [ ] Create tab/mode switching interface
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
